It is my view that in every property endeavour there is a consistent recipe that can be applied to benefit all projects big or small and from sector to sector. If you read a standard cooking recipe it's SIMPLE; made up of words for ingredients and numbers for quantities; this is the same approach I intend to apply throughout this reference. As I note that I have made a career out of dumbing down the technical to a form that is simple enough for me to understand; and if I can understand it, then most others can as well. For this reason I want to attempt to prepare a resource and reference tool that aims solve knowledge gaps as they arise.
