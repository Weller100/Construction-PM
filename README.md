# Construction-PM
Hi there, my name is Matt, and I'm a Project Manager working in construction management.
I am keen to produce a property resource that summarises the steps and reference tools needed throughout a property development project. It is my intention for this to be a platform that others can use to manage their own projects and to steer them in the right direction, similar to a recipe book for cooking.
